This is a React training repo

# Module 1: Introduction and Setup

In this module, we will begin to tell everything you need to know to set up your local environment and some tools that we are going to use in a near future and give some information about what we are going to see in this practice.

### Tooling and starer files

- First; you need to download and install [nodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local machine (I recommend to you; download the `LTS` version for this project)
- Then; go to this [commit](https://github.com/oscarpolanco/react-training/commit/989aac098cc93b5081e6c3f7492c67c3a3a0bc89) in this repository and copy the `frontend` and `backend` directory to your local folder of the practice
- Download the following extensions for your `browser`(I use `chrome` so use this as a reference to search for an equivalent on the browser that you are going to use):
  - [React devtool extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
  - [Apollo Client Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm)
- Now download and install [mongodb compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
- Need a terminal; I use [ITerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) but you can use the one of your preference
- Download and install an editor; I use [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can choose a different one

These are the tools that we are going to need in order to advance in this practice.

### Tech stack explained

In this practice we are going to be building an app called `sick fits` that will have the following:

- Show items with all their information
- A cart that you can add the items that you can buy
- Checkout process for the cart
- Create and see orders
- Create an account
- Authenticate with that account
- Modify your profile account
- Create items
- Sell your own items
- Search for an item
- Have a backend to add all page information as an admin

Here is the stack of technologies that we are going to be using to achieve those features of our app:

- Front-End:

  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - library to build user interfaces. `React` is really good to taken data; put it into templates and render it out on the DOM and when the data updates; `React` is really good at how efficiently update on the page.
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Is a framework for `React` that add `routing`; `pages`; `static rendering` or `on demand server rendering`; `images` and some more things.
  - [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) - Is a library that does a lot of things with `graphQL`; so in order to `query` data and create `charges` with needing a way to interact with the `graphQL` API to load the data; provide loading states; provide error states and to cache the data we are going to use this.
  - [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - Is a library that will help us to do scope `CSS` on `React`.

- Backend:
  - [Keystone.js](https://www.keystonejs.com/) - Is a framework that gives users a `headless CMS` that will allow you to log in to your `CMS`; create different `data types` and instead of giving you a `keystone` theme to output all the data to the `client`, it will give to you a `graphQL` API that will allow us to write `queries` to get all the data that we need. So we are going to use `Apollo` to make these `queries` and output our data on the `frontend` so `keystone` provide all the data and `Apollo` will fetch the data to injected into the application. `Keystone.js` is written on `nodeJs` and we will use `MongoDB` as our database.
    - [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/2)

## Module 2: Learning Next.js

On this module we will see the basics on `Next js` and build the first components that we are going to use on this app.

### An intro to Next

So `Next js` is a framework to build web applications using `React`. When we use `React` it will take your data and put it into templates then render that out to the page; when your data change it; the page will update. `Next js` is an entire framework that does routing; linking page to page; lazy loading; start to handle images; server-side rendering and static for pre-rendering out of the box.

You can see that you already have some directories to start with some basic files and on these files is the `package.json` that has all the dependencies that we are going to use on the project. So the first thing that we are going to do is on the `frontend` directory to begin to work with `Next js`. On your terminal go to the `frontend` directory and install all dependencies with the following command:
`npm install`

There is one directory that we need to be specific on `Next js` that is the `pages` directory that will be store all the components that represent the different pages of our application and `Next js` will handle the routing by default using this directory for example:

```bash
- pages/
-- order.js
```

`Next js` will use the `order` component when you are on the `http://localhost:7777/order`. This is called` file system base routing`

Now let's begin creating our pages:

- On your editor create go to the `pages` directory and create a file call `index.js`(Remember that the `pages` components should be in lowercase)
- Inside on the newly created file; export a function call `IndexPage`
  `export default function IndexPage() {}`
- Then return the following content on the function
  ```js
  export default function IndexPage() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Hello</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
- On to your terminal and go to the `frontend` directory
- Run your local server using the `dev` command: `npm run dev`
- On your browser go to http://localhost:7777/
- You should see the `Hello` message on the page

Now create the following `pages` that we will use on the application. Use the same message that we use on the `index.js` file.

|     Pages     | functions names |
| :-----------: | :-------------: |
| `account.js`  |  `AccountPage`  |
|  `order.js`   |   `OrderPage`   |
| `products.js` |  `ProductPage`  |
|   `sell.js`   |   `SellPage`    |

Another thing that we need to know about `Next js` is that out of the box do `server-side rendering` this means that when you do a `view source` of your page; it will show all the `HTML` then `React` will come and `rehydrate` it to have all the `React` functionality. `Next js` can also be `statically render` which means; that on build time you can pre-render pages so they load really quickly because the `HTML` of those pages will be already available.
